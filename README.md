💻 DEVROOM — Code Together, Learn Together

DEVROOM is a real-time collaborative coding platform that lets instructors and students join live coding sessions, write and run Python code together, chat in real time, and manage classroom-style sessions — all from the browser.


Where Developers Connect, Collaborate & Create.


✨ Features


Authentication — Register/login as a Student, Instructor, or Admin (JWT-based auth)
Role-based Dashboards — Separate dashboards for Students and Instructors
Live Coding Sessions — Shared Monaco code editor with real-time sync via Socket.IO
Python Code Execution — Run Python code directly from the editor
Real-time Chat — In-session chat between participants
Participant Management — View online participants, kick students (instructor-only)
Join via Link or Code — Students can join sessions using a link or a session code
File Upload/Download — Upload starter Python code, download your current code
Save Sessions — Persist code progress during a session
Assignments — Students can view and manage assignments from their dashboard

Setup & Installation

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+ recommended)
Python installed and available on your system PATH (required for code execution)
MongoDB (local or Atlas)


1. Clone the repository

bashgit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/devroom.git
cd devroom

2. Install dependencies

bashnpm install

3. Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

envPORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

4. Run the server

bashnpm start

The app will be available at http://localhost:5000 (or whichever PORT you set).

Socket.IO Events: joinRoom, codeChange/codeUpdate, chatMessage, userJoined, studentKicked, sessionEnded, admitResponse


Usage

Open index.html (or visit the deployed URL) and Register as a Student or Instructor.
Instructors can create a session and share the generated link/code with students.
Students join via link or session code from their dashboard.
Write Python code in the shared editor, run it, and see output live — all changes, chat, and participants sync in real time.



Notes
Make sure MongoDB is running and reachable via your MONGO_URI before starting the server.
Frontend currently calls the backend at http://localhost:5000 — update this in the HTML files if you deploy to a different host/port.
Python must be installed and accessible via the system PATH for the Run Code feature to work.
.env, node_modules/, temp/, and uploads/ should be excluded from version control (see .gitignore).
